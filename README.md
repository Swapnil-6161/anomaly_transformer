Anomaly Transformer: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Association Discrepancy

Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging problem, which requires the model to learn informative representation and derive a distinguishable criterion. In this paper, we propose the Anomaly Transformer in these three folds:

An inherent distinguishable criterion as Association Discrepancy for detection.
A new Anomaly-Attention mechanism to compute the association discrepancy.
A minimax strategy to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy.
